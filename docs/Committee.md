## PECAN Committee Structure

PECAN is structured as a small-scale version of the Faculty-wide Early Career Researcher Network and consist of four executive positions: two co-chairs (one man, one woman; LGBTIQA+ may apply for either position), a treasurer, and a secretary. PECAN members may include any individual who self identifies as an early career academic working within the school of (or broader topic areas covered by) psychological sciences.

To ensure clear communication between school committees and ECAs, PECAN has several committee representatives who attend and report on occurrences in key school committees and meetings, such as the MSPS research and research training sub-committee, the monthly school meeting, monthly hub meetings, the Faculty level early career researcher network, external relations committee, and the learning and teaching sub-committee. 

A gerneral committee including events coordinator, mentorship convenors, Hub Represntatives, and an OH&S representative, will be established as the organization grows.

Diversity is a priority in the make-up of PECAN ECA committees. We want to ensure issues affecting ECAs due to gender, culture, race, and accessibility are openly discussed and can be raised on behalf of all ECAs at the school and faculty level. Further, when individuals wish to raise these issues anonymously, that they feel comfortable seeking representation through the committee or a committee member directly.

A list of key committees and their ECA committee representatives, the current executive committee members, and members filling additional roles is avalible at the top of this page and on the internal MSPS site.

Members of the executive committee will be elected in an annual general meeting (AGM) open to all members. Founding executive committee members will act in a temporary role until the first AGM can be called.

To ensure continuity, co-chairs will be elected at the start and middle of each year and fulfill a one-year role (ECA positions are often yearly contracts), with a six-month overlap in co-chair appointments. Appointments may be extended beyond one-year at the AGM.

Treasurer and Secretary positions will be elected into one-year roles at the AGM, along with any additional committee positions that develop in the future. Positions created between AGMs will function in a temporary or 'acting' role and can be formalized at the following AGM.
