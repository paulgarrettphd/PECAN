## Contact PECAN

PECAN is working to become a formal part of the University of Melbourne's School of Psychological Sciences. When this happens, you will be able to contact us through our MSPS email address.

In the meantime, please contact Dr. Paul M. Garrett directly with issues related to PECAN at paul.garrett@unimelb.edu.au. He will be happy to add you to the PECAN memberlist or coordinate with you on any issues or ideas you may wish to raise with early career academics.

If you self-identify as an early career teacher or researcher working in the field of psychology at the University of Melbourne, please reach out and join this network. If you work outside of the university and wish to learn how this group was made to start your own PECAN society, or wish to request resources or advice from other ECAs, get in contact with PECAN through our email or email Dr. Paul M. Garrett directly.
