All Level A and above fixed term and continuing academics of the School who were awarded their PhD in the preceding 5 years (7-8 with career interuptions), who hold at least a 0.5FTE position in the School, and whose research is in the field of clinical or cognitive neuroscience and/or clinical neuropsychology may apply. The award must be expended in full by 30 Nov. 

Applicants will submit a short (two pages maximum) application that 1) documents their eligibility for the award (including description of their career interruption if appropriate); 2) outlines the proposed request and how the award will be spent on it; and 3) provides a short justification of the request in terms of its expected career benefit. 


### Friends of Psychology Early Career Award
Submission Date: Late March - Early April

Two $1000 awards, based on a competitive selection process, bestowed at the MSPS Awards Celebration. The award recipients will be expected to deliver a colloquium or seminar presentation on their research. This award is open to all Level A and above fixed term and continuing academics of the School who were awarded their PhD in the preceding 5 years or 7 years in the case of a career interruption, and who hold at least a 0.5 FTE position.

Applicants will make a specific request for funding to support a research-related purpose that is not covered by existing staff entitlements (e.g., to support research-related travel, help organise a Conference, attend a Conference or professional development activity, purchase equipment, research assistance or publication costs). The award would have to be expended in full by 30 Nov. 

Applicants will submit a short (two pages maximum) application that 1) documents their eligibility for the award (including description of their career interruption if appropriate); 2) outlines the proposed request and how the award will be spent on it; and 3) provides a short justification of the request in terms of its expected career benefit. 

### Early Career Publication Awards

MSPS offers four ECR publication awards:

- The Pip Pattison Early Career Research Award in cognitive and mathematical psychology
- The John Trinder Early Career Research Award in cognitive and behavioural neuroscience
- The Leon Mann Early Career Research Award in social and personality psychology
- The Margot Prior Early Career Research Award in clinical science

These awards are accompanied by a $500 cash prize and will be bestowed at the MSPS Awards Celebration. Each award is open to early career researchers within MSPS who have received their PhD no more than 5 years ago (not including career interruptions) and who hold at least a 0.5 FTE position. Preference will be given to researchers who did not receive one of the awards in the last round, but past award winners are welcome to apply. 

The nominated article must meet two requirements: 1) the early career researcher must be listed as first or sole author of the work; 2) it must have been published in an issue of a journal dated to the previous year (i.e., “in press” or “early view” articles cannot be nominated, unless there is documented evidence that the article will be assigned to a journal issue dated the previous year). Early career researchers can only nominate one publication and submit it for only one of the four prizes. 

Submissions must include 1) an electronic copy of the nominated article, and 2) a one-page document that states (i) the researcher's name, (ii) the award(s) for which the article is being nominated, (iii) a statement of the article's significance and contribution, and (iv) a brief statement of the researcher's contribution to the article if it is co-authored, (v) a justification based on career interruptions if appropriate. For currently "in press" articles that will have a publication dated to the previous year, evidence to that effect must also be submitted.

## External Early Career Awards

### Glushko Dissertation Prize
The Cognitive Science Society and the Glushko-Samuelson Foundation will award up to five outstanding dissertation prizes in cognitive science. The goals of these prizes are to increase the prominence of cognitive science, and encourage students to engage in interdisciplinary efforts to understand minds and intelligent systems. The hope is that the prizes will recognize and honor young researchers conducting ground-breaking research in cognitive science. The eventual goal is to aid in efforts to bridge between the areas of cognitive science and create theories of general interest to the multiple fields concerned with scientifically understanding the nature of minds and intelligent systems. Promoting a unified cognitive science is consistent with the belief that understanding how minds work will require the synthesis of many different empirical methods, formal tools, and analytic theories. 2011 was the inaugural year of this prize, and a new competition is held annually. [See details.](https://cognitivesciencesociety.org/glushko-dissertation-prize/)

Up to five Robert J. Glushko Dissertation/Ph.D. Thesis Prizes in Cognitive Science will be awarded annually. Each prize will be accompanied by a certificate and a USD $10,000 award to be used by the recipient without any constraints. Prize winners will also receive three years of complimentary membership in the Cognitive Science Society starting with the year in which they have won the prize.

Prize-winners must have received a PhD degree no more than two years before the February 11 nomination deadline. For the 2021 prizes, dissertations will be considered from individuals who received their PhD degrees during the period from February 11, 2019 to February 11, 2021.

Prize-winning dissertations/Ph.D. theses are expected to transcend any one of the individual fields comprising cognitive science. They should centrally address issues of interest to multiple fields that comprise cognitive science, including: psychology, computer science, philosophy, linguistics, anthropology, neuroscience, and education.

The dissertation/Ph.D. thesis prizes are open to any student who has conducted dissertation/thesis research related to cognitive science, regardless of nationality or originating department.
