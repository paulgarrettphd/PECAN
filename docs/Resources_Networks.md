## Early Career Researcher Network
The Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences (MDHS) Early Career Researcher (ECR) Network is a not-for-profit, ECR-run group associated with MDHS at the University of Melbourne. 

The ECRN focuses on Faculty wide ECR issues, and encourages members of PECAN to join their activities, become members or committee representatives. For those PECAN members looking for experience in faculty wide leadership oppertunities, the ECRN is a perfect starting place. 

ECRN hosts and raises awareness around faculty resources, workshops and events. PECAN will promote these resources, however, you can join the ECRN and follow their activities directly through the [ECRN MSPS sitepage](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/mdhsecrnetwork).

## GRiPS
GRiPS is run by dedicated graduate student volunteers who aim to foster a supportive and collaborative research community in the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, and provide opportunities for students to develop skills as part of the PhD Process. GRiPS hosts regular events, such as workshops, writing retreats, shut-up-and-write sessions, boardgame and pizza nights, and triva events. These events are open to graduate researchers and post-docs, and PECAN strongly encourages post-docs to join GRiPS for social engagement, mentorship oppertunities and leadership oppertunities, such as hosting GRiPS workshops on career building, writing, or analyses. [Contact GRiPS through their MSPS site page](https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/study/current-students/school-societies/grips), [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/MUGRIPS), or their email: grips.msps@gmail.com. 

## Melbourne Data Analytics Platform (MDAP)
We are a team of Academic Specialists who collaborate with researchers to enable data-intensive research across the University. We work with researchers at all stages of the research lifecycle, from research design and data collection, all the way through to analysis, visualisation, and interpretation. With a broad range of backgrounds and experiences, we are uniquely placed to make the most of all the benefits that interdisciplinary research can offer. 

We offer two primary streams of engagement:

- Collaborations: an allocation scheme for formal collaborative research projects lasting at least three months, with open calls occurring twice yearly.

- Consultancy, expert advice, advocacy and involvement in shorter term research projects.
