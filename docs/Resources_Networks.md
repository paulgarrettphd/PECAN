## Early Career Researcher Network
The Faculty of Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences (MDHS) Early Career Researcher (ECR) Network is a not-for-profit, ECR-run group associated with MDHS at the University of Melbourne. 

The ECRN focuses on Faculty wide ECR issues, and encourages members of PECAN to join their activities, become members or committee representatives. For those PECAN members looking for experience in faculty wide leadership oppertunities, the ECRN is a perfect starting place. 

ECRN hosts and raises awareness around faculty resources, workshops and events. PECAN will promote these resources, however, you can join the ECRN and follow their activities directly through the [ECRN MSPS sitepage](https://blogs.unimelb.edu.au/mdhsecrnetwork).
