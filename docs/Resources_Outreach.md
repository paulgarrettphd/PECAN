## News media

### Hub News - Press Releases
Hub New or Hub press releases are a first point of contact for new research news coming the School of Psych Sciences. If you have preliminary data you wish to promote and discuss, if you have a new paper that is being published, if you have begun a new international, Government or multidisiplinary collaboration, if you've received some funding or are starting a new lab, or if you are doing anything at all that would be of interest to researchers in your hub or the general public, write a short peice for your Hub's News Feed! 

These press releases can be very short but help build your skills in writing non-academic news articles, and build your outreach profile - a necessary part of many grant and job applications. 

Example press releases can be found on the [Complex Human Data Hub's](https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/research/hubs/chdh/news) News site, the [Ethics and Wellbeing Hub](https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/ethics-and-wellbeing-hub) page, and the [Decision Sciences Hub](https://psychologicalsciences.unimelb.edu.au/decision-science-hub/news-and-events) News site.

If your hub doesn't have a news page and you wish to write a press release, contact your hub coordinator or let PECAN know and we will contact them for you.

If you want to write a news piece, contact your hub coordinator and express an interest. They will be more than happy to help!

### University of Melbourne Newsroom
Newsroom is the central point of contact for all media enquiries to the University of Melbourne. The Newsroom team promotes University research, manages requests for expert commentary and produces the daily Experts Alert for journalists. These alerts notify Journalists of new articles published in Pursuit or outlets like the Conversation, so that journalists can book interviews with University of Melbourne researchers.

The Newsroom team are very receptive to any questions and will provide basic training and advice on how to handle interviews and questions, what you can expect from publishing in certain outlets, what to expect when giving interviews at specific networks or radio shows, and how to make your research accessible and topical for the public. If you are about to publish a new article, you should be getting in contact with the Newsroom and making them aware of your work! 

Contact details for the Newsroom staff can be [found here](https://about.unimelb.edu.au/newsroom/contact-us). In 2021, the main points for contact for Medicine, Dental and Health Sciences are:

- Holly Watkins - holly.watkins@unimelb.edu.au
- Cheryl Critchley (Tues-Thurs, 8am-5pm) - cheryl.critchley@unimelb.edu.au

### University of Melbourne's Pursit
[Pursuit](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/) is the University of Melbourne’s content website, showcasing our research and its impact on the world through stories, videos, blogs and podcasts. If you are new to writing news articles, Pursuit is the perfect place to get your start. 

Pursuit pieces are generally 700-800 words and written for a general audience. This comes with strong social media promotion so it reaches the public direct but also goes to media and can potentially be republished – similar to The Conversation. If the story needs to be told in a longer format the team will discuss this with you at the time the article is commissioned.

Pursuit publish several different ways to tell a story: an [article](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/is-australia-becoming-the-lonely-country), a [Q&A](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/the-legal-maze-of-the-marriage-equality-survey) article, a [listicle](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/5-slightly-disgusting-facts-about-mozzies), a [Go Figure](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/jaw-dropping-so-how-does-a-snake-eat-a-man) (an explanatory article answering a specific question), an [Under the Microscope](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/meet-the-cow-whisperer) (focusing on a person), a [slideshow](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/ecocity-snapshots-from-around-the-world) (a picture driven story), a [podcast](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/podcasts/why-feeling-pain-is-key-to-our-happiness) or a [video](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/are-these-australia-s-happiest-dairy-cows). How we best tell a story and on what platform depends on the content itself, and the decision will be made in consultation with you.

If you are publishing new research or have a topic idea you wish to discuss, then reach out to the Pursuit team and pitch them a story that might capture the interest of the general public. You can find the editor and senior journalist [contact details here](https://pursuit.unimelb.edu.au/articles/contact-the-pursuit-team), or instead, go through the University of Melbourne Newsroom and they will contact Pursuit for you.

### The Conversation
The Conversation Australia and New Zealand is a unique collaboration between academics and journalists that in just 10 years has become the world’s leading publisher of research-based news and analysis.

Every article is created by academics and journalists working together, supported by a team of digital technology experts. Our professional editors turn knowledge and insights from academics into easy-to-read articles, and make them accessible to readers.

All our work is free to read and free to republish under Creative Commons. We do this as a not-for-profit company guided by a clear purpose: to provide access to quality explanatory journalism essential for healthy democracy.

To be published by The Conversation you must be currently employed as a researcher or academic with a university or research institution. PhD candidates under supervision by an academic can write for us, but we don’t currently publish articles from Masters students.

If you are interested in writing a topical piece on research in your field or research you are conducting, [pitch The Conversation an atricle](https://theconversation.com/au/pitches) idea through their site. 

Be aware that only a fraction of the received pitches are accepted, however, they do respond to all pitches within 72 hours.

## Personal Outreach

### Pint of Science
[Pint of Science Australia](https://pintofscience.com.au/) runs events to bring researchers across all fields of science, technology, engineering, mathematics and medicine to share their recent discoveries with the local community.

The main festival takes place annually over three days in the month of May as part of the broader international Pint of Science festival: a fantastic celebration of science that reaches all across the globe. Researchers present a short presentation of their most interesting work at a public venule, like a pub, in a way that maximises public engagement & knowledge.

We group our events into six main categories that cover the broad scope of what we call science:

- Atoms to Galaxies: physics, chemistry, maths, astronomy

- Beautiful Mind: neuroscience, psychology and psychiatry

- Our Body: medicine, human biology, health

- Our Society: law, history, politics, policy, languages

- Planet Earth: geosciences, plant sciences, zoology

- Tech Me Out: biotechnology, robotics, computers

If you would like to present at a Pint of Science evenet, check the [locations](https://pintofscience.com.au/locations/) page to see where your nearest pint venue is and contact [Pint of Science AU through their site.](https://pintofscience.com.au/contact/).

### Personal Sites & Blogs
Personal site building can seem intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. The current PECAN site was built in under 2 days using free, easy-to-format themes from makedocs. You can also pay a small fee and build a custom site through Squarespace with little fuss and time.

Personal sites are increasingly important when going for jobs and grants, providing a place for an academic to host their own open-science content, such as code, articles, teaching content, conference papers and talks, YouTube presentations, CVs and a public facing summary of their recent work and academic work history. If you wish to build a site like PECAN, look in our Academic Tools section on Personal Site building via Mkdocs. 

Personal sites are also where you can host publicly accessible analyses. For example, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many researchers were posting survey results online in real-time, so as to notify research teams and Governments of their latest findings without delay. There are obviously peer-review issues in doing this, however, personal sites and analysis tools such as WorkflowR (see Academic Tools), give academics the freedom to get important results out in the public in real-time when necessary.

Blogs are less common among young researchers, however, they do show a sustained committement to research outreach and can look good on job applications where outreach is key.
