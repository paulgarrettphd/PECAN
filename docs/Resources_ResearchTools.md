### Git-Hub and Bitbucket
GitHub and Bitbucket are code and resource hosting platforms for Git version control and collaboration, that lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere in the world. Bitbucket was initially distict from GitHub being a private repository (others can't see your work); however, GitHub now has both public and private repository options making this distinction mostly redundant.

Once upon a time, learning and using Git was reserved for hardcore coders, however, today anyone can easily use GitHub and BitBucket through their Graphical User Interfaces - GitDesktop and SourceTree! These services function in the same way as Dropbox, allowing you to keep your work in a dedicated Git Folder which is uploaded to your free repository at the *push* of a button. If you want to download a repository or updated repository files, you can instead click the *pull* request. 

There are many cool advanced features in Git repositories - brancing folders, merging folders, timed version control so you can revert to old versions of files and folders - and a little Git understanding can help in hosting a personal website (exactly like this one which is hosted through GitHub) and can save you the nightmare of losing work, code, and papers when your computer inevitably crashes. 

[Download Git here](https://git-scm.com/downloads), and get started with GitHub through this [simple user guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and download [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) to make getting started easy.

## Referencing Tools

### Google Scholar Button
If you don't know about this button, then let us help. The Google scholar button is a google chrome extension that searchers for the citation of either i) the paper that is currently open on your browser, or ii) a paper you request in its searchbar. You can then immediately download that paper's citation in MLA, APA, Chicargo, Harvard, Vancouver, Bibtex, Endnote, RefMan or RefWorks formats.

### Reference managers
Reference managers, such as [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com), [Endnote](https://endnote.com/), [ReadCube Papers](https://www.papersapp.com/), and [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org) help manage references, images, links, and pdf's and easily generate bibliographies as you write.

### Bibtex 
[Bibtex](https://unimelb.libguides.com/latexbibtex) is a citation style that can automatically generate & format a bibliography in a LaTeX document. First you need to create a bibliography database file with the extension .bib containing bibliographic entries. You can then use a \cite{} command in LaTeX to automatically create an in-text citation and add the formatted citation to your reference list. Note that you can gernerate a bibtex citation through the above reference managers or directly from the google scholar button.

## Collaborative Writing Tools

### Overleaf (LaTeX)
Writing isn't easy and staying motivated can be hard. Although writing processes like Microsoft Word are often the default among academics, modern alternatives eixst that help you write quickly and format documents to Journal Specifications. Prime among these is [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/), a LaTeX scripting language that formats your document (page layout, citation style, title page, heading styles, figure placements, everything!) to a Journal's specifications all through a few simple commands. If you find LaTeX source code intimidating, Overleaf also has a Rich Text Editor (like Microsoft Word) to make transitioning to LaTeX just that bit easier. Overleaf is free to use, hosted online so you can work on your paper from anywhere, and if you signup using your university staff email, you will have access to all of its paid-for features, such as track changes, commenting, and git-hub integration.

### Google docs
Google Docs is Google's browser-based word processor. You can create, edit, and share documents online and access them from any computer with an internet connection. What sets Google Docs apart from its main desktop competitor, Microsoft Word, are its collaborative features. Google Docs was one of the first word processors to offer shared online document editing.

Google has made it incredibly easy to share documents across platforms and work on them together in real time from a browser window. Your collaborators don't even need a Google account to view or edit Google documents you share with them.

Moreover, Google Docs add-ons, let you expand the functionality and add missing features. For example, you can include LaTeX code and equations through a Google Docs plug-in, meaning you can have the functionality of a Word Processer + the flexability of a tex editor. 

The downsides of Google Doc are similar to a normal word processor (minus the easy collboration features) in that Journal Formatting is a manual process and resubmitting manuscripts can be a time consuming process (changing reference formats etc). Fortunately Endnote/Zotero plug-ins can help in these instaces.

If you're after a collaborative word processer without the complexities of a LaTeX editor, then Google Docs is probably for you.

## Analysis Tools

### SPSS
[SPSS](https://www.ibm.com/analytics/spss-statistics-software?lnk=STW_US_STESCH&lnk2=trial_SPSS&pexp=def&psrc=none&mhsrc=ibmsearch_a&mhq=SPSS) is a powerful statistical and data management software package that uses a graphical user interface and supports an internal coding language for advanced analyses. SPSS is widely used and taught in many undergraduate psychology courses and is useful for data cleaning, analysis, and basic graphics and plotting (but not APA style!). The University currently has a site licence for SPSS, however, the program is not free to use otherwise. If you plan to share your analyses with collaborators on in online repositories, it may be better to use an open-source analysis alternative, such as JASP or JAMOVI. 

### SAS: Statistical Analysis Software
SAS is a broad statistical and analytical program. It allows you to manage data, data mine, graphics and statistical analysis. The user interface is designed for researchers and has several components that deal with analysis and data reporting. SAS comes with a lot of online support, has consultants who work at the University, and is a staple of many undergraduate courses. For beginners the user interface is not the easiest to work, with a terminal more similar to a coding lagnuage like R, but SAS does have a large range of capabilities and can be a good place to start learning more advanced coding (as opposed to point-and-click) analysis techniques. It is a popular alternative to SPSS, and is considered better for handling large databases. SAS has a university site licence and is avalible through the university for all operating systems on computers owned by the University or for download on your personal computer. Online courses can be accessed through the [SAS website](https://www.sas.com/en_us/training/overview.html).

### JASP - Just Another Stat Program
[JASP](https://jasp-stats.org/) is a free to use Stastistical package designed for Psychology Researchers by the University of Amsterdam and an excellent substitute for graphical user interface programs, such as SPSS. JASP carries out both Frequentist (p-value) and Bayesian analyses, outputs results in APA format, recevies regular updates, refreshes results in real-time (no more running & re-running results from scratch!) and is a growing part of many undergraduate statistical courses. If you wish to move away from the costly fees and non-APA formated results of SPSS but don't wish to learn a new analysis language like R or python, then try JASP. 

### JAMOVI
[JAMOVI](https://www.jamovi.org/) is a free to use Statistical software that aims to bridge the gap between researchers and statisticans. Many advanced statistical methods are being made by mathematical psychologists, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, and statisticans, but are only avalible through the open-source langage of R. JAMOVI integrates with R to make these resources avalible in a Graphical User Interface (e.g., JASP, SPSS) that psychological researchers are more familar with. 

Similar to JASP, JAMOVI performs analyses in real-time (no waiting or re-running scripts), performs both frequentist and bayesian analyses, outputs results in APA format, is regularly updated, and is receiving support through university and online courses. Where JAMOVI differes from JASP is that all analyses are actually performed in R with the code accessible to the researcher in-real-time. In fact, you can run your JAMOVI R-script in R to get the exact same results. If learning to code is on your to-do list, and you're not sure where to start, consider the free-to-use JAMOVI. 

### Stata
[Stata](https://www.stata.com/) is a complete, integrated statistical package that provides tools for data analysis, data management, and graphics. Stata can be used for standard methods and advanced techniques, such as survival models with frailty, dynamic panel data (DPD) regressions, generalized estimating equations (GEE), multilevel mixed models, models with sample selection, multiple imputation, ARCH, and estimation with complex survey samples. STATA generates publication-quality graphs, including regression fit graphs, time-series graphs, survival plots, and contour plots.

Stata may be useful for anyone looking to carry out more advanced modelling through a graphical user interface, however, no university wide licence currently exists. If you need to access Stat, it is avalible on two computeres on the 10th floor of the Redmond Barry Building (near the lockers). Due to the issue of accessiblity and cost, it is strongly recommended academics consider the other analysis tools avalible on this list.

## Coding Languages
Find tools that help you learn coding langauges that are needed in Academic and industy jobs. Key languages include Python, Matlab, R, C and C++, and Javascript.

### Python
Python is the coding language of choice in many industry and academic jobs. The language is designed first and foremost for readability - good python code is understandable with very little expertise - and second, for speed. Python and its many open-source libraries is excellent for a host of purposes, including data management, machine learning, site building, experimentation (e.g., psychopy & pygame), database integration, webscraping, figure plotting, and much more. Python is often recommended as a resarchers first language and due to its extreme flexability, is a highly desirable skillset in both academic and industry jobs.

#### Psychopy
[Psychopy](https://www.psychopy.org/) is a free graphical user interface for building online and inlab experiments. Simple experiments can be programed in Psychopy though a drag-and-drop style experimental-timeline interface, while more advanced experiments, sequences, and stimuli can be programed in base-python. Psychopy uses many functions adapted from the popular experimental and game building library, pygame, making it easy for experienced pygame users to quickly modify and extend existing psychpy experiments. If you're building your first experiment in python and don't want to jump straight into coding from sctach, psychopy is a great place to start.

### Matlab
[Matlab](https://au.mathworks.com/) is a proprietary coding language designed for and by engineers, that received enormous backing and package development by psychophysicists, cognitive scientists and neuroscientists in the 1990's - 2010's, and is still popular today. Matlab is a grphical user interface desigend to take advantage of matrix math and matrix manipulation to quickly perform large-scale computations, and comes with many useful packages, such as the Psychtoolbox and Psychophysics Toolbox for precise response-time experimentation, the Image Processing Toolbox for fMRI and EEG visualization, the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox for machine learning, and the Eyelink Toolbox for eye-tracking data. The University of Melbourne has a site licence for Matlab and the software can be accessed on campus or downloaded to your personal computer.

### GNU Octave
[GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) is the most well known alternative to Matlab. If you are familar with Matlab and are looking for a free alternative, consider using GNU Octave.

---

### R & Rstudio
[R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and the associated graphical user interface [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/), is a staple of the open-science movment in neuroscience, social and cognitive psychology. R has a long history in psychology and was made noticably accessible with the free publication ['Learning Statistics with R'](https://learningstatisticswithr.com/), an extremely accessible textbook by prominent Cognitive Scientist, Danielle Navaro. This textbook coveres everything from learning the basics of coding, to t-tests, correlations, ANOVAs and Bayesian statistical analysis. If you don't know where to start, try Learning Statistics with R.

R offers an incredibly flexable statistical language with easy-to-download open-source packages that can perform advanced statistical techniques as designed by world leading scientists. These packages are often designed for and by psychological scientists and science communicators, meaning popular packages such as Tidyverse and GGplot are designed with ease-of-use and clear communication in mind.

Because R is a free software, the langauge does not have the same assurances (e.g., backwards compatability, packages maintainance with major updates) as paid softwares, such as Matlab. However, R has an incredibly active scientific community that ensures bread-and-butter analysis packages (e.g., tidyverse, GGplot) are well maintained, and new analysis techniques (e.g., heirarchical Bayesian modelling, partical sampling techniques, social network analyses) are always being added.

If you are after a flexable statistical langauge with access to cutting edge psychological analysis techniques, R might be for you. 


#### Rmarkdown
[Rmarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a relativly new form of R document that allows researchers to write their analyses and text in the same file (similar to a word file with embedded and usable code). Rmarkdown makes writing tutorials increadibly easy and intiutive, allows you to share your preliminary results with collaborators in a way where the method, code and results are clearly shown all in one place, and can be hosted online as an html or pdf document for ease-of-sharing. 

#### WorkflowR
[WorkflowR](https://jdblischak.github.io/workflowr/index.html) (pronounced workflower) is an Rmarkdown framework for reproducible and collaborative data science. WorkflowR allows you to write an Rmarkdown document and upload the results in real time through a git-lab or git-hub repository, posting the report online for collaborators to see immediately. If you are working on an international project, if you want to publish your results in real time (e.g., survey results during the COVID-19 pandemic), if you want to share your findings with your supervisor or collaborators as you go, then WorkflowR might be exactly what you're looking for.

### HTML, CSS and JavaScript
To build websites, you should know about HTML, the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a webpage. HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define.

Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) is the second internet technology after HTML. While HTML handles the structure and content, CSS styles your page and lays it out. For example, you can use CSS to alter the font, color, size, and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features.

Javascript is the programming langauge that handels any dynamic interactions that occur on a webpage - button clicks, motion, 2D and 3D graphics, scrolling and viedos, everything that isn't a static image has some JavaScript involved.

Learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript is a big ask when desigining online experiments as a psychological researcher. While most online courses and tutorials treat these lanauges as integrative - you learn them somewhat together as they's how you often use them - there are easier ways to start making online studies...

#### JSpsych
[JSpsych](https://www.jspsych.org/) is a JavaScript library for running behavioral experiments in a web browser. The library provides a flexible framework for building a wide range of laboratory-like experiments that can be run online.

To use jsPsych, you provide a description of the experiment in the form of a timeline. jsPsych handles things like determining which trial to run next, storing data, and randomization. jsPsych uses plugins to define what to do at each point on the timeline. Plugins are ready-made templates for simple experimental tasks like displaying instructions or displaying a stimulus and collecting a keyboard response. Plugins are very flexible to support a wide variety of experiments. It is easy to create your own plugin if you have experience with JavaScript programming, and if you don't have experience, it's relaitvely easy to learn. Visit the [JSpsych site](https://www.jspsych.org/) to start making your own online studies!

## Personal Sites
Design your own webpage where you can host links to your projects, papers, code, teaching resources, CV and awards. Make it easy for potential employers to see why they should hire you.

### Mkdocs
[Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) (pronounced makedocs) is a free static-site builder which offers various customisable themes for you to make your webpage for free. Mkdocs is usually used to build wiki-like pages for internal use in companies or for open-access repositories, however, it can easily be used to build a static personalized site - for example, PECAN! Learn how to build a site with [Mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) and host your site through git-hub for free.
