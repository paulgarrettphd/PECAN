Writing isn't easy and staying motivated can be hard. Although writing processes like Microsoft Word are often the default among academics, modern alternatives eixst that help you write quickly and format documents to Journal Specifications. Prime among these is Overleaf, a LaTeX scripting language that formats your document (page layout, citation style, title page, heading styles, figure placements) to a Journal's specifications all through a few simple commands. If you find LaTeX source code intimidating, Overleaf also has a Rich Text Editor (like Microsoft Word) to make transitioning to LaTeX just that bit easier. Overleaf is free to use, and if you signin using your university staff email, you will have access to all of its paid-for features, such as track changes, commenting, and git-hub integration.
