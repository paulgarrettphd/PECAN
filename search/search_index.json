These issues are not unique to the school or university. PECAN aims to work with the Research Hubs, School of Psychological Sciences and the University of Melbourne to address these issues. The more supported our young researchers are, the more likely they will go on to innovative research, teaching and industry careers that benefit everyone. PECAN Peer-Networking issues ECAs do not know how to contact one another, who other ECAs are, and are not notified when ECAs enter or leave the school. ECAs cannot easily connect with other peers, limiting their ability to seek advice, mentorship, or hear about the experiences of other ECAs. ECAs entering MSPS do not have a school-based point of contact that can answer questions related to conducting research or teaching in the school as an ECA, living and working in Melbourne, and building social networks within and outside of the university. There are ECA resources provided by the Faculty that could be accessed if they were made available in a space MSPS ECAs know to access. ECAs often pursue similar career goals, such as grants and awards, however, do not have a readily accessible collection of resources and materials from which to learn. This disadvantages ECAs who don\u2019t have an established peer network from which to request such materials. These resources could be volunteered and made available (anonymously, if required) in a centralized repository accessible by all ECAs, increasing the likelihood of ECAs achieving career milestones, such as obtaining grants and awards. School and PECAN issues ECAs do not have a centralized point of information sharing. Therefore, decisions made by committees, schools, the Faculty, and external networks such as the Early Career Researcher Network, cannot be easily communicated. ECAs are among the most unlikely to voice their concerns at school or hub meetings. Their contracts are often short and insecure. Furthermore, with relatively few ECAs present in the school, ECAs lack anonymity in raising their concerns and could benefit from a collective body that ensures their anonymity while still having their voices heard. ECAs predominantly seek career advice from their supervisors. However, supervisors may be providing advice based on out-of-date experience. With grant and job requirements updated almost yearly, ECAs need to know what to prioritize (e.g., public outreach, teaching) to succeed in today\u2019s job market and/or grant systems, and the school needs to support ECAs in meeting these requirements. School, Hub, and Committee issues ECAs often need to show teaching experience, specifically lecturing experience, when applying for continuing contracts. Guest lecturing is the best way to gain this experience. However, guest lecturing from ECA\u2019s is not prioritized in MSPS courses. Job descriptions for ECAs generally allocate 100% of their time to research or teaching roles. ECAs are intentionally not included on committees to protect this time, however, this decision may harm their ability to show leadership skills when going for future jobs and grants. ECA time must remain protected, however, voluntary ECA positions could be made available on key committees to ensure leadership opportunities and information sharing among PECAN. ECAs interact with and receive support from their respective Hubs to differing degrees, with many not knowing how to interact with their hubs productively. ECAs could interact with hubs more effectively in two capacities: leadership roles & collaborations. Leadership roles: ECAs may advance their leadership, teaching, and career-building by running voluntary hub workshops (in their own, and in other hubs). This would also make ECAs accessible to Ph.D. and future Ph.D. students, affording opportunities for mentorship or future supervision. Collaborations: ECAs may form ECA-led collaborations that use the resources from one or more Hubs collaboratively. Although Snr Academics would be welcome on these projects, it would be good for ECAs to have an opportunity to perform independently led projects to showcase academic leadership qualities.","title":"ECA Issues"},{"location":"ECA_Issues/#early-carrer-academic-issues","text":"Several issues have been identified by ECAs within the University of Melbourne's school of Psychological Sciences.

FTE refers to full time equivolence, with FTE 1.0 indicative of 10 days in a fortnight (aka full time), and FTE 0.1 indicative of 1 day in a fortnight. It is important when researchers consider grants and research positions that they also consider their external life goals. Research is often conducted on short-term contracts, which unless you are very fortunate or very well-off, can harm your chances of getting a house-loan and if you are an international researcher, can make staying in Australia between contracts on a working VISA very difficult. This information isn't presented to discourage you from a research career, but instead is to ensure you are aware and can plan for these issues well in advance of them becoming a problem. We hope you find success in the list of grants and fellowships below. Internal Grants and Fellowships McKenzie Fellowship Allocation: A.6 Appointment (~$93,000 p/a) + $25,000 funding for up to 3 years (FTE 1.0). Due in May (currently unavalible). The McKenzie Postdoctoral Fellowship was established to attract outstanding recent doctoral graduates to the University from around the world. This fellowship is not avalible to researchers who graduated from the University of Melbourne and the applicate must have a PhD awarded in the preceeding two-year period. The Program aims to recruit new researchers who have the potential to build and lead interdisciplinary collaborative research activities inside and across academic diciplines. The University will fund the fellowship for a three year appointment commencing at Level A.6 in the University salary band plus superannuation. Fellows will receive an additional $25,000 to be spent on project costs over the term of their Fellowship. Awards will be for a maximum of three years commencing between 1 January 2021 and 30 June 2021. The McKenzie Fellowship is highly competitive, with up to ten McKenzie Fellowships and one Indigenous McKenzie Fellowship available each year. In 2021, the McKenzie fellowship was suspended due to financial constriants imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the fellowship may be reintroduced in 2022. Prospective applicants must discuss their interest in the Program with the relevant Academic Division - the school of psychological sciences - at the University of Melbourne, prior to submitting their application. Applicants will be required to provide a declaration of support from the department/school in which they would be located if successful. Application processes vary between different faculties. Applicants must adhere to Faculty Expression of Interest processes and timelines in order to be considered. Note: annecdotal accounts of the McKenzie fellowship indicated that supervision was limited and the candidate was expected to act as an independent researcher (Principle Investigator). School Bridging Fellowships Allocation: A.6 Appointment (~$93,000 p/a) funding for 1 year (FTE 1.0). Due in October (currently unavalible). The Bridging Fellowship scheme supports researchers who have recently completed their PhDs for one year of intensive postdoctoral research in collaboration with an academic member of the School. These fellowships are usually provided to early career researchers who have a proven academic record and who were unsuccessful in their recent grant applications, or who show promise as an asset to the school and were unable to be funded through other grant-based means. Hub Fellowships Allocation: A.6+ Appointment (~$93,000 p/a) funding for 1 year (FTE 0.4-1.0). Hub fellowships are uncommon and are usually allocated by the School or Hub with a specific purpose in mind. For example, Paul Garrett was funded for 1 year at A.6 (FTE .6) as a Complex Human Data Hub research fellow to help secure the hub's future Centre for Excellence bid. Coming with clear requirements, these positions can be quite beneficial to a research career (often multiple publications can come from such clear and directed research), however, their short-term nature makes them difficult to commit to if other, longer-term post-doctoral positions become avalible. Similarly, for a researcher seeking a short-term contract with the University while they await a future grant, Hub Fellowships can be extremely attractive. Melbourne Research Fellowships (Career Interruptions) Program The objective of the Melbourne Research Fellowships (Career Interruptions) Program is to enable eligible researchers who are University of Melbourne staff and who do not have a continuing research position whose careers have been severely interrupted, delayed or otherwise constrained by circumstances such as acute or chronic illness, child bearing, child rearing or primary responsibility for the sustained care of a dependent family member to enhance or re-establish their academic research careers. See dates and information. Early Career Researcher Grant Research funding for successful applicants commences January for a period of 12 months. Grants will be awarded with a maximum of $40,000 for Science, Medicine, Dentistry and Health Sciences (psychology). Half of awarded funding to successful projects is to be provided via co-contribution from your Academic Division - the school of psychological sciences & faculty of medicine, dentistry and health sciences. The objectives of this scheme are to support early career researchers who demonstrate clear evidence of high research potential to progress their research careers; Encourage establishment of an early career researcher\u2019s research program; Provide competitive funding for high quality research projects and pilot research projects; Provide early career researchers with experience in preparing a grant application for peer review; Build early career researchers\u2019 track record in order to enhance competitiveness in bidding for external research funds; Provide research funding for projects that are strategically aligned with the University\u2019s priorities. See details and dates for this scheme here. Additional Researcher Development Schemes Click here to view additional researcher development schemes offered through the University of Melbourne. The above schemes are but a selection of the most obviously applicable to psychology-based researchers. Early Stage External ECA Grants ARC DECRA (Discovery Early Career Researcher Award) To support and advance promising early career researchers (less than 5 years postdoctoral experience); promote enhanced opportunities for diverse career pathways; focus research effort in the National Research Priority areas to improve research capacity and policy outcomes; and enable research and research training in high quality and supportive environments. See details. ARC Discovery Indigenous ECR Award The Discovery Indigenous scheme provides funding to Administering Organisations to support research programs led by an Indigenous Australian researcher and build research capacity of higher degree research and early career researchers. See details. NHMRC Young Investigator Award The Investigator Grant scheme is to support the health and medical research program of outstanding investigators at all career stages. It will consolidate separate salary and research support into a single grant scheme by offering a salary component (if required) and a research support package (RSP). The Emerging Leadership (EL) Category is restricted to researchers who are \u226410 years post-PhD or equivalent and comprises two salary levels, EL1 and EL2, with corresponding RSPs. An Investigator Grants 2021 (for funding commencing 2022) grant opportunity is awarded for a five year term and may be awarded as either a full-time or a part-time grant. See details. Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council: David Phillips Fellowships David Phillips Fellowships provide support to outstanding scientists who are in the initial stages of their career and who are seeking to establish their first independent research group. The fellowships invest in scientists who have shown high potential, can demonstrate that they are on an upward trajectory with clear evidence of strong scientific outputs and leadership qualities, and are aiming to establish their own fully independent programme of research. Through the fellowships, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council will be seeking to identify scientists who can be expected to be among the future leaders of their generation. Total value up to $2,300,000. To be eligible for this scholarship, you need to hold a PhD, but not hold, have held or had the offer of an academic position at Lecturer level (or the equivalent in institutions other than universities). It is expected that applicants will have at least three years of active postdoctoral research experience. See details. ETH Zurich: Branco Weiss Fellowships The Branco Weiss Fellowship is a postdoctoral program for exceptionally qualified young researchers. The fellowship consists of a personal research grant that enables the fellows to work on their projects anywhere in the world, for up to five years. The Fellowship is designed to support postdoctoral researchers after their PhD and before their first faculty appointment. Eligible candidates must have obtained their PhD a maximum of five years prior to January 15, 2020, officially hold a PhD on January 15, 2020, and not hold or have held a faculty-equivalent position (e.g. assistant professor or lecturer). Branco Weiss Fellows are expected to present novel approaches in their research, departing from the mainstream. Applicants must submit a project that exploits new avenues of research, often transdisciplinary. They must also provide evidence of outstanding achievement in their particular scientific field and be willing to engage in a dialogue on relevant social, cultural, political or economic issues across the frontiers of their particular discipline. Ideal projects follow new paths in an interdisciplinary setting. See details. Fulbright Scholarships This scholarship supports Australian students to study in the US. The attributes Fulbright Scholarship selection panels look for include high academic and professional merit, a strong program proposal, well defined potential project outcomes and ambassadorial skills. The Australian-American Fulbright Commission offers scholarships to individuals seeking to undertake postdoctoral research in the U.S. for a period of 3 to 10 months, who have completed their PhD in the past 5 years or who will have their PhD conferral before the proposed date of departure. Further scholarships may also be applied for which extended this scholarship. This award comes with a monthly stipend based on the cost of living in the city of the host institution, round-trip, economy class airfare directly to and from the scholar\u2019s home city and the city of the host institution, establishment allowance, dependent allowance- if applicable, Health & Accident Insurance (ASPE), extensive support including media support, and orientation and enrichment opportunities \u2013 in Australia and the U.S. Applications open 6 January 2021 - 6 July 2021.

If you find LaTeX source code intimidating, Overleaf also has a Rich Text Editor (like Microsoft Word) to make transitioning to LaTeX just that bit easier. Overleaf is free to use, hosted online so you can work on your paper from anywhere, and if you signup using your university staff email, you will have access to all of its paid-for features, such as track changes, commenting, and git-hub integration. Google docs TBD. Analysis Tools SPSS SPSS is a powerful statistical and data management software package that uses a graphical user interface and supports an internal coding language for advanced analyses. SPSS is widely used and taught in many undergraduate psychology courses and is useful for data cleaning, analysis, and basic graphics and plotting (but not APA style!). The University currently has a site licence for SPSS, however, the program is not free to use otherwise. If you plan to share your analyses with collaborators on in online repositories, it may be better to use an open-source analysis alternative, such as JASP or JAMOVI. SAS: Statistical Analysis Software SAS is a broad statistical and analytical program. It allows you to manage data, data mine, graphics and statistical analysis. The user interface is designed for researchers and has several components that deal with analysis and data reporting. SAS comes with a lot of online support, has consultants who work at the University, and is a staple of many undergraduate courses. For beginners the user interface is not the easiest to work, with a terminal more similar to a coding lagnuage like R, but SAS does have a large range of capabilities and can be a good place to start learning more advanced coding (as opposed to point-and-click) analysis techniques. It is a popular alternative to SPSS, and is considered better for handling large databases. SAS has a university site licence and is avalible through the university for all operating systems on computers owned by the University or for download on your personal computer. Online courses can be accessed through the SAS website . JASP - Just Another Stat Program JASP is a free to use Stastistical package designed for Psychology Researchers by the University of Amsterdam and an excellent substitute for graphical user interface programs, such as SPSS. JASP carries out both Frequentist (p-value) and Bayesian analyses, outputs results in APA format, recevies regular updates, refreshes results in real-time (no more running & re-running results from scratch!) and is a growing part of many undergraduate statistical courses. If you wish to move away from the costly fees and non-APA formated results of SPSS but don't wish to learn a new analysis language like R or python, then try JASP. JAMOVI JAMOVI is a free to use Statistical software that aims to bridge the gap between researchers and statisticans. Many advanced statistical methods are being made by mathematical psychologists, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, and statisticans, but are only avalible through the open-source langage of R. JAMOVI integrates with R to make these resources avalible in a Graphical User Interface (e.g., JASP, SPSS) that psychological researchers are more familar with. Similar to JASP, JAMOVI performs analyses in real-time (no waiting or re-running scripts), performs both frequentist and bayesian analyses, outputs results in APA format, is regularly updated, and is receiving support through university and online courses. Where JAMOVI differes from JASP is that all analyses are actually performed in R with the code accessible to the researcher in-real-time. In fact, you can run your JAMOVI R-script in R to get the exact same results. If learning to code is on your to-do list, and you're not sure where to start, consider the free-to-use JAMOVI. Stata Stata is a complete, integrated statistical package that provides tools for data analysis, data management, and graphics. Stata can be used for standard methods and advanced techniques, such as survival models with frailty, dynamic panel data (DPD) regressions, generalized estimating equations (GEE), multilevel mixed models, models with sample selection, multiple imputation, ARCH, and estimation with complex survey samples. STATA generates publication-quality graphs, including regression fit graphs, time-series graphs, survival plots, and contour plots. Stata may be useful for anyone looking to carry out more advanced modelling through a graphical user interface, however, no university wide licence currently exists. If you need to access Stat, it is avalible on two computeres on the 10th floor of the Redmond Barry Building (near the lockers). Due to the issue of accessiblity and cost, it is strongly recommended academics consider the other analysis tools avalible on this list. Coding Languages Find tools that help you learn coding langauges that are needed in Academic and industy jobs. Key languages include Python, Matlab, R, C and C++, and Javascript. Python Python is the coding language of choice in many industry and academic jobs. The language is designed first and foremost for readability - good python code is understandable with very little expertise - and second, for speed. Python and its many open-source libraries is excellent for a host of purposes, including data management, machine learning, site building, experimentation (e.g., psychopy & pygame), database integration, webscraping, figure plotting, and much more. Python is often recommended as a resarchers first language and due to its extreme flexability, is a highly desirable skillset in both academic and industry jobs. Psychopy Psychopy is a free graphical user interface for building online and inlab experiments. Simple experiments can be programed in Psychopy though a drag-and-drop style experimental-timeline interface, while more advanced experiments, sequences, and stimuli can be programed in base-python. Psychopy uses many functions adapted from the popular experimental and game building library, pygame, making it easy for experienced pygame users to quickly modify and extend existing psychpy experiments. If you're building your first experiment in python and don't want to jump straight into coding from sctach, psychopy is a great place to start. Matlab Matlab is a proprietary coding language designed for and by engineers, that received enormous backing and package development by psychophysicists, cognitive scientists and neuroscientists in the 1990's - 2010's, and is still popular today. Matlab is a grphical user interface desigend to take advantage of matrix math and matrix manipulation to quickly perform large-scale computations, and comes with many useful packages, such as the Psychtoolbox and Psychophysics Toolbox for precise response-time experimentation, the Image Processing Toolbox for fMRI and EEG visualization, the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox for machine learning, and the Eyelink Toolbox for eye-tracking data. The University of Melbourne has a site licence for Matlab and the software can be accessed on campus or downloaded to your personal computer. GNU Octave GNU Octave is the most well known alternative to Matlab. If you are familar with Matlab and are looking for a free alternative, consider using GNU Octave. R & Rstudio R and the associated graphical user interface Rstudio , is a staple of the open-science movment in neuroscience, social and cognitive psychology. R has a long history in psychology and was made noticably accessible with the free publication 'Learning Statistics with R' , an extremely accessible textbook by prominent Cognitive Scientist, Danielle Navaro. This textbook coveres everything from learning the basics of coding, to t-tests, correlations, ANOVAs and Bayesian statistical analysis. If you don't know where to start, try Learning Statistics with R. R offers an incredibly flexable statistical language with easy-to-download open-source packages that can perform advanced statistical techniques as designed by world leading scientists. These packages are often designed for and by psychological scientists and science communicators, meaning popular packages such as Tidyverse and GGplot are designed with ease-of-use and clear communication in mind. Because R is a free software, the langauge does not have the same assurances (e.g., backwards compatability, packages maintainance with major updates) as paid softwares, such as Matlab. However, R has an incredibly active scientific community that ensures bread-and-butter analysis packages (e.g., tidyverse, GGplot) are well maintained, and new analysis techniques (e.g., heirarchical Bayesian modelling, partical sampling techniques, social network analyses) are always being added. If you are after a flexable statistical langauge with access to cutting edge psychological analysis techniques, R might be for you. Rmarkdown Rmarkdown is a relativly new form of R document that allows researchers to write their analyses and text in the same file (similar to a word file with embedded and usable code). Rmarkdown makes writing tutorials increadibly easy and intiutive, allows you to share your preliminary results with collaborators in a way where the method, code and results are clearly shown all in one place, and can be hosted online as an html or pdf document for ease-of-sharing. WorkflowR WorkflowR (pronounced workflower) is an Rmarkdown framework for reproducible and collaborative data science. WorkflowR allows you to write an Rmarkdown document and upload the results in real time through a git-lab or git-hub repository, posting the report online for collaborators to see immediately. If you are working on an international project, if you want to publish your results in real time (e.g., survey results during the COVID-19 pandemic), if you want to share your findings with your supervisor or collaborators as you go, then WorkflowR might be exactly what you're looking for.
