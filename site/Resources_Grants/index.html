<p>Monetary values reflect 2020-2021 prices in AUD unless specified otherwise. FTE refers to full time equivolence, with FTE 1.0 indicative of 10 days in a fortnight (aka full time), and FTE 0.1 indicative of 1 day in a fortnight. </p>
<p>It is important when researchers consider grants and research positions that they also consider their external life goals. Research is often conducted on short-term contracts, which unless you are very fortunate or very well-off, can harm your chances of getting a house-loan and if you are an international researcher, can make staying in Australia between contracts on a working VISA very difficult. This information isn't presented to discourage you from a research career, but instead is to ensure you are aware and can plan for these issues well in advance of them becoming a problem.</p>
<p>We hope you find success in the list of grants and fellowships below. </p>

<p>Allocation: A.6 Appointment (~$93,000 p/a) + $25,000 funding for up to 3 years (FTE 1.0). Due in May (currently unavalible).</p>
<p><a href="https://sites.research.unimelb.edu.au/research-funding/researcher-development-schemes/mckenzie-fellowship">The McKenzie Postdoctoral Fellowship</a> was established to attract outstanding recent doctoral graduates to the University from around the world. This fellowship is not avalible to researchers who graduated from the University of Melbourne and the applicate must have a PhD awarded in the preceeding two-year period. The Program aims to recruit new researchers who have the potential to build and lead interdisciplinary collaborative research activities inside and across academic diciplines.</p>
<p>The University will fund the fellowship for a three year appointment commencing at Level A.6 in the University salary band plus superannuation. Fellows will receive an additional $25,000 to be spent on project costs over the term of their Fellowship. Awards will be for a maximum of three years commencing between 1 January 2021 and 30 June 2021.</p>
<p>The McKenzie Fellowship is highly competitive, with up to ten McKenzie Fellowships and one Indigenous McKenzie Fellowship available each year. In 2021, the McKenzie fellowship was suspended due to financial constriants imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the fellowship <em>may</em> be reintroduced in 2022. </p>
<p>Prospective applicants must discuss their interest in the Program with the relevant Academic Division - the school of psychological sciences - at the University of Melbourne, prior to submitting their application. Applicants will be required to provide a declaration of support from the department/school in which they would be located if successful. Application processes vary between different faculties. Applicants must adhere to Faculty Expression of Interest processes and timelines in order to be considered.</p>
<p>Note: annecdotal accounts of the McKenzie fellowship indicated that supervision was limited and the candidate was expected to act as an independent researcher (Principle Investigator). </p>
<h3 id="school-bridging-fellowships">School Bridging Fellowships</h3>
<p>Allocation: A.6 Appointment (~$93,000 p/a) funding for 1 year (FTE 1.0). Due in October (currently unavalible).</p>
<p>The Bridging Fellowship scheme supports researchers who have recently completed their PhDs for one year of intensive postdoctoral research in collaboration with an academic member of the School. These fellowships are usually provided to early career researchers who have a proven academic record and who were unsuccessful in their recent grant applications, or who show promise as an asset to the school and were unable to be funded through other grant-based means.</p>
<h3 id="hub-fellowships">Hub Fellowships</h3>
<p>Allocation: A.6+ Appointment (~$93,000 p/a) funding for 1 year (FTE 0.4-1.0).</p>
<p>Hub fellowships are uncommon and are usually allocated by the School or Hub with a specific purpose in mind. For example, Paul Garrett was funded for 1 year at A.6 (FTE .6) as a Complex Human Data Hub research fellow to help secure the hub's future Centre for Excellence bid. Coming with clear requirements, these positions can be quite beneficial to a research career (often multiple publications can come from such clear and directed research), however, their short-term nature makes them difficult to commit to if other, longer-term post-doctoral positions become avalible. Similarly, for a researcher seeking a short-term contract with the University while they await a future grant, Hub Fellowships can be extremely attractive.</p>
