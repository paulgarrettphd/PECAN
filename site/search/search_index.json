PECAN members may include any individual who self identifies as an early career academic working within the school of (or broader topic areas covered by) psychological sciences. To ensure clear communication between school committees and ECAs, PECAN has several committee representatives who attend and report on occurrences in key school committees and meetings, such as the MSPS research and research training sub-committee, the monthly school meeting, monthly hub meetings, the Faculty level early career researcher network, external relations committee, and the learning and teaching sub-committee. A gerneral committee including events coordinator, mentorship convenors, Hub Represntatives, and an OH&S representative, will be established as the organization grows. Diversity is a priority in the make-up of PECAN ECA committees. We want to ensure issues affecting ECAs due to gender, culture, race, and accessibility are openly discussed and can be raised on behalf of all ECAs at the school and faculty level. Further, when individuals wish to raise these issues anonymously, that they feel comfortable seeking representation through the committee or a committee member directly. A list of key committees and their ECA committee representatives, the current executive committee members, and members filling additional roles is avalible at the top of this page and on the internal MSPS site. Members of the executive committee will be elected in an annual general meeting (AGM) open to all members. Founding executive committee members will act in a temporary role until the first AGM can be called. To ensure continuity, co-chairs will be elected at the start and middle of each year and fulfill a one-year role (ECA positions are often yearly contracts), with a six-month overlap in co-chair appointments. Appointments may be extended beyond one-year at the AGM. Treasurer and Secretary positions will be elected into one-year roles at the AGM, along with any additional committee positions that develop in the future. Positions created between AGMs will function in a temporary or 'acting' role and can be formalized at the following AGM.","title":"Committee"},{"location":"Committee/#executive-committee-members","text":"Co-Chair: Dr. Paul M.

These issues are not unique to the school or university. PECAN aims to work with the Research Hubs, School of Psychological Sciences and the University of Melbourne to address these issues. The more supported our young researchers are, the more likely they will go on to innovative research, teaching and industry careers that benefit everyone. PECAN Peer-Networking issues ECAs do not know how to contact one another, who other ECAs are, and are not notified when ECAs enter or leave the school. ECAs cannot easily connect with other peers, limiting their ability to seek advice, mentorship, or hear about the experiences of other ECAs. ECAs entering MSPS do not have a school-based point of contact that can answer questions related to conducting research or teaching in the school as an ECA, living and working in Melbourne, and building social networks within and outside of the university. There are ECA resources provided by the Faculty that could be accessed if they were made available in a space MSPS ECAs know to access. ECAs often pursue similar career goals, such as grants and awards, however, do not have a readily accessible collection of resources and materials from which to learn. This disadvantages ECAs who don\u2019t have an established peer network from which to request such materials. These resources could be volunteered and made available (anonymously, if required) in a centralized repository accessible by all ECAs, increasing the likelihood of ECAs achieving career milestones, such as obtaining grants and awards. School and PECAN issues ECAs do not have a centralized point of information sharing. Therefore, decisions made by committees, schools, the Faculty, and external networks such as the Early Career Researcher Network, cannot be easily communicated. ECAs are among the most unlikely to voice their concerns at school or hub meetings. Their contracts are often short and insecure. Furthermore, with relatively few ECAs present in the school, ECAs lack anonymity in raising their concerns and could benefit from a collective body that ensures their anonymity while still having their voices heard. ECAs predominantly seek career advice from their supervisors. However, supervisors may be providing advice based on out-of-date experience. With grant and job requirements updated almost yearly, ECAs need to know what to prioritize (e.g., public outreach, teaching) to succeed in today\u2019s job market and/or grant systems, and the school needs to support ECAs in meeting these requirements. School, Hub, and Committee issues ECAs often need to show teaching experience, specifically lecturing experience, when applying for continuing contracts. Guest lecturing is the best way to gain this experience. However, guest lecturing from ECA\u2019s is not prioritized in MSPS courses. Job descriptions for ECAs generally allocate 100% of their time to research or teaching roles. ECAs are intentionally not included on committees to protect this time, however, this decision may harm their ability to show leadership skills when going for future jobs and grants. ECA time must remain protected, however, voluntary ECA positions could be made available on key committees to ensure leadership opportunities and information sharing among PECAN. ECAs interact with and receive support from their respective Hubs to differing degrees, with many not knowing how to interact with their hubs productively. ECAs could interact with hubs more effectively in two capacities: leadership roles & collaborations. Leadership roles: ECAs may advance their leadership, teaching, and career-building by running voluntary hub workshops (in their own, and in other hubs). This would also make ECAs accessible to Ph.D. and future Ph.D. students, affording opportunities for mentorship or future supervision. Collaborations: ECAs may form ECA-led collaborations that use the resources from one or more Hubs collaboratively. Although Snr Academics would be welcome on these projects, it would be good for ECAs to have an opportunity to perform independently led projects to showcase academic leadership qualities.","title":"ECA Issues"},{"location":"ECA_Issues/#early-carrer-academic-issues","text":"Several issues have been identified by ECAs within the University of Melbourne's school of Psychological Sciences.
