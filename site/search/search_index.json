PECAN members may include any individual who self identifies as an early career academic working within the school of (or broader topic areas covered by) psychological sciences. To ensure clear communication between school committees and ECAs, PECAN has several committee representatives who attend and report on occurrences in key school committees and meetings, such as the MSPS research and research training sub-committee, the monthly school meeting, monthly hub meetings, the Faculty level early career researcher network, external relations committee, and the learning and teaching sub-committee. A gerneral committee including events coordinator, mentorship convenors, Hub Represntatives, and an OH&S representative, will be established as the organization grows.

These issues are not unique to the school or university. PECAN aims to work with the Research Hubs, School of Psychological Sciences and the University of Melbourne to address these issues. The more supported our young researchers are, the more likely they will go on to innovative research, teaching and industry careers that benefit everyone. PECAN Peer-Networking issues ECAs do not know how to contact one another, who other ECAs are, and are not notified when ECAs enter or leave the school. ECAs cannot easily connect with other peers, limiting their ability to seek advice, mentorship, or hear about the experiences of other ECAs. ECAs entering MSPS do not have a school-based point of contact that can answer questions related to conducting research or teaching in the school as an ECA, living and working in Melbourne, and building social networks within and outside of the university. There are ECA resources provided by the Faculty that could be accessed if they were made available in a space MSPS ECAs know to access. ECAs often pursue similar career goals, such as grants and awards, however, do not have a readily accessible collection of resources and materials from which to learn. This disadvantages ECAs who don\u2019t have an established peer network from which to request such materials. These resources could be volunteered and made available (anonymously, if required) in a centralized repository accessible by all ECAs, increasing the likelihood of ECAs achieving career milestones, such as obtaining grants and awards. School and PECAN issues ECAs do not have a centralized point of information sharing. Therefore, decisions made by committees, schools, the Faculty, and external networks such as the Early Career Researcher Network, cannot be easily communicated. ECAs are among the most unlikely to voice their concerns at school or hub meetings. Their contracts are often short and insecure. Furthermore, with relatively few ECAs present in the school, ECAs lack anonymity in raising their concerns and could benefit from a collective body that ensures their anonymity while still having their voices heard. ECAs predominantly seek career advice from their supervisors. However, supervisors may be providing advice based on out-of-date experience. With grant and job requirements updated almost yearly, ECAs need to know what to prioritize (e.g., public outreach, teaching) to succeed in today\u2019s job market and/or grant systems, and the school needs to support ECAs in meeting these requirements. School, Hub, and Committee issues ECAs often need to show teaching experience, specifically lecturing experience, when applying for continuing contracts. Guest lecturing is the best way to gain this experience. However, guest lecturing from ECA\u2019s is not prioritized in MSPS courses. Job descriptions for ECAs generally allocate 100% of their time to research or teaching roles. ECAs are intentionally not included on committees to protect this time, however, this decision may harm their ability to show leadership skills when going for future jobs and grants. ECA time must remain protected, however, voluntary ECA positions could be made available on key committees to ensure leadership opportunities and information sharing among PECAN. ECAs interact with and receive support from their respective Hubs to differing degrees, with many not knowing how to interact with their hubs productively. ECAs could interact with hubs more effectively in two capacities: leadership roles & collaborations. Leadership roles: ECAs may advance their leadership, teaching, and career-building by running voluntary hub workshops (in their own, and in other hubs). This would also make ECAs accessible to Ph.D. and future Ph.D. students, affording opportunities for mentorship or future supervision. Collaborations: ECAs may form ECA-led collaborations that use the resources from one or more Hubs collaboratively. Although Snr Academics would be welcome on these projects, it would be good for ECAs to have an opportunity to perform independently led projects to showcase academic leadership qualities.","title":"ECA Issues"},{"location":"ECA_Issues/#early-carrer-academic-issues","text":"Several issues have been identified by ECAs within the University of Melbourne's school of Psychological Sciences.

The award recipients will be expected to deliver a colloquium or seminar presentation on their research. This award is open to all Level A and above fixed term and continuing academics of the School who were awarded their PhD in the preceding 5 years or 7 years in the case of a career interruption, and who hold at least a 0.5 FTE position. Applicants will make a specific request for funding to support a research-related purpose that is not covered by existing staff entitlements (e.g., to support research-related travel, help organise a Conference, attend a Conference or professional development activity, purchase equipment, research assistance or publication costs). The award would have to be expended in full by 30 Nov. Applicants will submit a short (two pages maximum) application that 1) documents their eligibility for the award (including description of their career interruption if their PhD was granted in 2013-4); 2) outlines the proposed request and how the award will be spent on it; and 3) provides a short justification of the request in terms of its expected career benefit. Early Career Publication Awards MSPS offers four ECR publication awards: The Pip Pattison Early Career Research Award in cognitive and mathematical psychology The John Trinder Early Career Research Award in cognitive and behavioural neuroscience The Leon Mann Early Career Research Award in social and personality psychology The Margot Prior Early Career Research Award in clinical science These awards are accompanied by a $500 cash prize and will be bestowed at the MSPS Awards Celebration. Each award is open to early career researchers within MSPS who have received their PhD no more than 5 years ago (not including career interruptions) and who hold at least a 0.5 FTE position. Preference will be given to researchers who did not receive one of the awards in the last round, but past award winners are welcome to apply. The nominated article must meet two requirements: 1) the early career researcher must be listed as first or sole author of the work; 2) it must have been published in an issue of a journal dated to the previous year (i.e., \u201cin press\u201d or \u201cearly view\u201d articles cannot be nominated, unless there is documented evidence that the article will be assigned to a journal issue dated the previous year). Early career researchers can only nominate one publication and submit it for only one of the four prizes. Submissions must include 1) an electronic copy of the nominated article, and 2) a one-page document that states (i) the researcher's name, (ii) the award(s) for which the article is being nominated, (iii) a statement of the article's significance and contribution, and (iv) a brief statement of the researcher's contribution to the article if it is co-authored, (v) a justification based on career interruptions if appropriate. For currently \"in press\" articles that will have a publication dated to the previous year, evidence to that effect must also be submitted. External Early Career Awards Glushko Dissertation Prize The Cognitive Science Society and the Glushko-Samuelson Foundation will award up to five outstanding dissertation prizes in cognitive science. The goals of these prizes are to increase the prominence of cognitive science, and encourage students to engage in interdisciplinary efforts to understand minds and intelligent systems. The hope is that the prizes will recognize and honor young researchers conducting ground-breaking research in cognitive science. The eventual goal is to aid in efforts to bridge between the areas of cognitive science and create theories of general interest to the multiple fields concerned with scientifically understanding the nature of minds and intelligent systems. Promoting a unified cognitive science is consistent with the belief that understanding how minds work will require the synthesis of many different empirical methods, formal tools, and analytic theories. 2011 was the inaugural year of this prize, and a new competition is held annually. See details. Up to five Robert J. Glushko Dissertation/Ph.D. Thesis Prizes in Cognitive Science will be awarded annually. Each prize will be accompanied by a certificate and a USD $10,000 award to be used by the recipient without any constraints. Prize winners will also receive three years of complimentary membership in the Cognitive Science Society starting with the year in which they have won the prize. Prize-winners must have received a PhD degree no more than two years before the February 11 nomination deadline. For the 2021 prizes, dissertations will be considered from individuals who received their PhD degrees during the period from February 11, 2019 to February 11, 2021. Prize-winning dissertations/Ph.D. theses are expected to transcend any one of the individual fields comprising cognitive science. They should centrally address issues of interest to multiple fields that comprise cognitive science, including: psychology, computer science, philosophy, linguistics, anthropology, neuroscience, and education. The dissertation/Ph.D. thesis prizes are open to any student who has conducted dissertation/thesis research related to cognitive science, regardless of nationality or originating department.","title":"Awards"},{"location":"Resources_Awards/#internal-early-career-awards","text":"","title":"Internal Early Career  Awards"},{"location":"Resources_Awards/#friends-of-psychology-early-career-award","text":"Submission Date: Late March - Early April Two $1000 awards, based on a competitive selection process, bestowed at the MSPS Awards Celebration.

It is important when researchers consider grants and research positions that they also consider their external life goals. Research is often conducted on short-term contracts, which unless you are very fortunate or very well-off, can harm your chances of getting a house-loan and if you are an international researcher, can make staying in Australia between contracts on a working VISA very difficult. This information isn't presented to discourage you from a research career, but instead is to ensure you are aware and can plan for these issues well in advance of them becoming a problem.

This fellowship is not avalible to researchers who graduated from the University of Melbourne and the applicate must have a PhD awarded in the preceeding two-year period. The Program aims to recruit new researchers who have the potential to build and lead interdisciplinary collaborative research activities inside and across academic diciplines. The University will fund the fellowship for a three year appointment commencing at Level A.6 in the University salary band plus superannuation. Fellows will receive an additional $25,000 to be spent on project costs over the term of their Fellowship. Awards will be for a maximum of three years commencing between 1 January 2021 and 30 June 2021. The McKenzie Fellowship is highly competitive, with up to ten McKenzie Fellowships and one Indigenous McKenzie Fellowship available each year. In 2021, the McKenzie fellowship was suspended due to financial constriants imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the fellowship may be reintroduced in 2022. Prospective applicants must discuss their interest in the Program with the relevant Academic Division - the school of psychological sciences - at the University of Melbourne, prior to submitting their application. Applicants will be required to provide a declaration of support from the department/school in which they would be located if successful. Application processes vary between different faculties. Applicants must adhere to Faculty Expression of Interest processes and timelines in order to be considered. Note: annecdotal accounts of the McKenzie fellowship indicated that supervision was limited and the candidate was expected to act as an independent researcher (Principle Investigator). School Bridging Fellowships Allocation: A.6 Appointment (~$93,000 p/a) funding for 1 year (FTE 1.0). Due in October (currently unavalible). The Bridging Fellowship scheme supports researchers who have recently completed their PhDs for one year of intensive postdoctoral research in collaboration with an academic member of the School.

Hub Fellowships Allocation: A.6+ Appointment (~$93,000 p/a) funding for 1 year (FTE 0.4-1.0). Hub fellowships are uncommon and are usually allocated by the School or Hub with a specific purpose in mind. For example, Paul Garrett was funded for 1 year at A.6 (FTE .6) as a Complex Human Data Hub research fellow to help secure the hub's future Centre for Excellence bid. Coming with clear requirements, these positions can be quite beneficial to a research career (often multiple publications can come from such clear and directed research), however, their short-term nature makes them difficult to commit to if other, longer-term post-doctoral positions become avalible. Similarly, for a researcher seeking a short-term contract with the University while they await a future grant, Hub Fellowships can be extremely attractive. Melbourne Research Fellowships (Career Interruptions) Program The objective of the Melbourne Research Fellowships (Career Interruptions) Program is to enable eligible researchers who are University of Melbourne staff and who do not have a continuing research position whose careers have been severely interrupted, delayed or otherwise constrained by circumstances such as acute or chronic illness, child bearing, child rearing or primary responsibility for the sustained care of a dependent family member to enhance or re-establish their academic research careers.

Bitbucket was initially distict from GitHub being a private repository (others can't see your work); however, GitHub now has both public and private repository options making this distinction mostly redundant. Once upon a time, learning and using Git was reserved for hardcore coders, however, today anyone can easily use GitHub and BitBucket through their Graphical User Interfaces - GitDesktop and SourceTree! These services function in the same way as Dropbox, allowing you to keep your work in a dedicated Git Folder which is uploaded to your free repository at the push of a button. If you want to download a repository or updated repository files, you can instead click the pull request. There are many cool advanced features in Git repositories - brancing folders, merging folders, timed version control so you can revert to old versions of files and folders - and a little Git understanding can help in hosting a personal website (exactly like this one which is hosted through GitHub) and can save you the nightmare of losing work, code, and papers when your computer inevitably crashes. Download Git here , and get started with GitHub through this simple user guide and download GitHub Desktop to make getting started easy. Git-Lab Dropbox OneDrive Referencing Tools Google Scholar Button If you don't know about this button, then let us help. The Google scholar button is a google chrome extension that searchers for the citation of either i) the paper that is currently open on your browser, or ii) a paper you request in its searchbar. You can then immediately download that paper's citation in MLA, APA, Chicargo, Harvard, Vancouver, Bibtex, Endnote, RefMan or RefWorks formats. Reference managers Reference managers, such as Mendeley , Endnote , ReadCube Papers , and Zotero help manage references, images, links, and pdf's and easily generate bibliographies as you write. Bibtex Bibtex is a citation style that can automatically generate & format a bibliography in a LaTeX document. First you need to create a bibliography database file with the extension .bib containing bibliographic entries. You can then use a \\cite{} command in LaTeX to automatically create an in-text citation and add the formatted citation to your reference list. Note that you can gernerate a bibtex citation through the above reference managers or directly from the google scholar button. Meta Analysis and Systematic Review Tools TBA. Collaborative Writing Tools Overleaf (LaTeX) Writing isn't easy and staying motivated can be hard. Although writing processes like Microsoft Word are often the default among academics, modern alternatives eixst that help you write quickly and format documents to Journal Specifications. Prime among these is Overleaf , a LaTeX scripting language that formats your document (page layout, citation style, title page, heading styles, figure placements, everything!) to a Journal's specifications all through a few simple commands. If you find LaTeX source code intimidating, Overleaf also has a Rich Text Editor (like Microsoft Word) to make transitioning to LaTeX just that bit easier. Overleaf is free to use, hosted online so you can work on your paper from anywhere, and if you signup using your university staff email, you will have access to all of its paid-for features, such as track changes, commenting, and git-hub integration. Google docs Google Docs is Google's browser-based word processor. You can create, edit, and share documents online and access them from any computer with an internet connection. What sets Google Docs apart from its main desktop competitor, Microsoft Word, are its collaborative features. Google Docs was one of the first word processors to offer shared online document editing. Google has made it incredibly easy to share documents across platforms and work on them together in real time from a browser window. Your collaborators don't even need a Google account to view or edit Google documents you share with them. Moreover, Google Docs add-ons, let you expand the functionality and add missing features. For example, you can include LaTeX code and equations through a Google Docs plug-in, meaning you can have the functionality of a Word Processer + the flexability of a tex editor. The downsides of Google Doc are similar to a normal word processor (minus the easy collboration features) in that Journal Formatting is a manual process and resubmitting manuscripts can be a time consuming process (changing reference formats etc). Fortunately Endnote/Zotero plug-ins can help in these instaces. If you're after a collaborative word processer without the complexities of a LaTeX editor, then Google Docs is probably for you. Analysis Tools SPSS SPSS is a powerful statistical and data management software package that uses a graphical user interface and supports an internal coding language for advanced analyses. SPSS is widely used and taught in many undergraduate psychology courses and is useful for data cleaning, analysis, and basic graphics and plotting (but not APA style!). The University currently has a site licence for SPSS, however, the program is not free to use otherwise. If you plan to share your analyses with collaborators on in online repositories, it may be better to use an open-source analysis alternative, such as JASP or JAMOVI. SAS: Statistical Analysis Software SAS is a broad statistical and analytical program. It allows you to manage data, data mine, graphics and statistical analysis. The user interface is designed for researchers and has several components that deal with analysis and data reporting. SAS comes with a lot of online support, has consultants who work at the University, and is a staple of many undergraduate courses. For beginners the user interface is not the easiest to work, with a terminal more similar to a coding lagnuage like R, but SAS does have a large range of capabilities and can be a good place to start learning more advanced coding (as opposed to point-and-click) analysis techniques. It is a popular alternative to SPSS, and is considered better for handling large databases. SAS has a university site licence and is avalible through the university for all operating systems on computers owned by the University or for download on your personal computer. Online courses can be accessed through the SAS website . JASP - Just Another Stat Program JASP is a free to use Stastistical package designed for Psychology Researchers by the University of Amsterdam and an excellent substitute for graphical user interface programs, such as SPSS. JASP carries out both Frequentist (p-value) and Bayesian analyses, outputs results in APA format, recevies regular updates, refreshes results in real-time (no more running & re-running results from scratch!) and is a growing part of many undergraduate statistical courses. If you wish to move away from the costly fees and non-APA formated results of SPSS but don't wish to learn a new analysis language like R or python, then try JASP. JAMOVI JAMOVI is a free to use Statistical software that aims to bridge the gap between researchers and statisticans. Many advanced statistical methods are being made by mathematical psychologists, cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, and statisticans, but are only avalible through the open-source langage of R. JAMOVI integrates with R to make these resources avalible in a Graphical User Interface (e.g., JASP, SPSS) that psychological researchers are more familar with. Similar to JASP, JAMOVI performs analyses in real-time (no waiting or re-running scripts), performs both frequentist and bayesian analyses, outputs results in APA format, is regularly updated, and is receiving support through university and online courses. Where JAMOVI differes from JASP is that all analyses are actually performed in R with the code accessible to the researcher in-real-time. In fact, you can run your JAMOVI R-script in R to get the exact same results. If learning to code is on your to-do list, and you're not sure where to start, consider the free-to-use JAMOVI. Stata Stata is a complete, integrated statistical package that provides tools for data analysis, data management, and graphics. Stata can be used for standard methods and advanced techniques, such as survival models with frailty, dynamic panel data (DPD) regressions, generalized estimating equations (GEE), multilevel mixed models, models with sample selection, multiple imputation, ARCH, and estimation with complex survey samples. STATA generates publication-quality graphs, including regression fit graphs, time-series graphs, survival plots, and contour plots. Stata may be useful for anyone looking to carry out more advanced modelling through a graphical user interface, however, no university wide licence currently exists. If you need to access Stat, it is avalible on two computeres on the 10th floor of the Redmond Barry Building (near the lockers). Due to the issue of accessiblity and cost, it is strongly recommended academics consider the other analysis tools avalible on this list. Coding Languages Find tools that help you learn coding langauges that are needed in Academic and industy jobs. Key languages include Python, Matlab, R, C and C++, and Javascript. Python Python is the coding language of choice in many industry and academic jobs. The language is designed first and foremost for readability - good python code is understandable with very little expertise - and second, for speed. Python and its many open-source libraries is excellent for a host of purposes, including data management, machine learning, site building, experimentation (e.g., psychopy & pygame), database integration, webscraping, figure plotting, and much more. Python is often recommended as a resarchers first language and due to its extreme flexability, is a highly desirable skillset in both academic and industry jobs. Psychopy Psychopy is a free graphical user interface for building online and inlab experiments. Simple experiments can be programed in Psychopy though a drag-and-drop style experimental-timeline interface, while more advanced experiments, sequences, and stimuli can be programed in base-python. Psychopy uses many functions adapted from the popular experimental and game building library, pygame, making it easy for experienced pygame users to quickly modify and extend existing psychpy experiments. If you're building your first experiment in python and don't want to jump straight into coding from sctach, psychopy is a great place to start. Matlab Matlab is a proprietary coding language designed for and by engineers, that received enormous backing and package development by psychophysicists, cognitive scientists and neuroscientists in the 1990's - 2010's, and is still popular today. Matlab is a grphical user interface desigend to take advantage of matrix math and matrix manipulation to quickly perform large-scale computations, and comes with many useful packages, such as the Psychtoolbox and Psychophysics Toolbox for precise response-time experimentation, the Image Processing Toolbox for fMRI and EEG visualization, the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox for machine learning, and the Eyelink Toolbox for eye-tracking data. The University of Melbourne has a site licence for Matlab and the software can be accessed on campus or downloaded to your personal computer. GNU Octave GNU Octave is the most well known alternative to Matlab. If you are familar with Matlab and are looking for a free alternative, consider using GNU Octave. R & Rstudio R and the associated graphical user interface Rstudio , is a staple of the open-science movment in neuroscience, social and cognitive psychology. R has a long history in psychology and was made noticably accessible with the free publication 'Learning Statistics with R' , an extremely accessible textbook by prominent Cognitive Scientist, Danielle Navaro. This textbook coveres everything from learning the basics of coding, to t-tests, correlations, ANOVAs and Bayesian statistical analysis. If you don't know where to start, try Learning Statistics with R. R offers an incredibly flexable statistical language with easy-to-download open-source packages that can perform advanced statistical techniques as designed by world leading scientists. These packages are often designed for and by psychological scientists and science communicators, meaning popular packages such as Tidyverse and GGplot are designed with ease-of-use and clear communication in mind. Because R is a free software, the langauge does not have the same assurances (e.g., backwards compatability, packages maintainance with major updates) as paid softwares, such as Matlab. However, R has an incredibly active scientific community that ensures bread-and-butter analysis packages (e.g., tidyverse, GGplot) are well maintained, and new analysis techniques (e.g., heirarchical Bayesian modelling, partical sampling techniques, social network analyses) are always being added. If you are after a flexable statistical langauge with access to cutting edge psychological analysis techniques, R might be for you. Rmarkdown Rmarkdown is a relativly new form of R document that allows researchers to write their analyses and text in the same file (similar to a word file with embedded and usable code). Rmarkdown makes writing tutorials increadibly easy and intiutive, allows you to share your preliminary results with collaborators in a way where the method, code and results are clearly shown all in one place, and can be hosted online as an html or pdf document for ease-of-sharing. WorkflowR WorkflowR (pronounced workflower) is an Rmarkdown framework for reproducible and collaborative data science. WorkflowR allows you to write an Rmarkdown document and upload the results in real time through a git-lab or git-hub repository, posting the report online for collaborators to see immediately. If you are working on an international project, if you want to publish your results in real time (e.g., survey results during the COVID-19 pandemic), if you want to share your findings with your supervisor or collaborators as you go, then WorkflowR might be exactly what you're looking for. HTML, CSS and JavaScript To build websites, you should know about HTML, the fundamental technology used to define the structure of a webpage. HTML is used to specify whether your web content should be recognized as a paragraph, list, heading, link, image, multimedia player, form, or one of many other available elements or even a new element that you define. Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) is the second internet technology after HTML. While HTML handles the structure and content, CSS styles your page and lays it out.

JSpsych JSpsych is a JavaScript library for running behavioral experiments in a web browser. The library provides a flexible framework for building a wide range of laboratory-like experiments that can be run online. To use jsPsych, you provide a description of the experiment in the form of a timeline. jsPsych handles things like determining which trial to run next, storing data, and randomization. jsPsych uses plugins to define what to do at each point on the timeline. Plugins are ready-made templates for simple experimental tasks like displaying instructions or displaying a stimulus and collecting a keyboard response. Plugins are very flexible to support a wide variety of experiments. It is easy to create your own plugin if you have experience with JavaScript programming, and if you don't have experience, it's relaitvely easy to learn.
